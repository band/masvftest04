- push last night failed with 'username' error.
- but the gitconfig info looks good.
   credential.helper=manager
   
 - CTRL-u forces GitHub Desktop login, but then push fails with
```shell
git obsidian error: Push failed Logon failed, ust ctrl+c to cancel basic credential prompt
...
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': no such file or directory
Pushing to https://github.com/band/masvftest04.git
```


- push works using GitHub Desktop

Testing GCM
https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core/releases/tag/v2.0.474

this install brings up the previous "login via browser" message and once logged in you can authorize GCM to authorize remote pushes.

yay!
