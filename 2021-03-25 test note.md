# 2021-03-25 test note

Just ran through the following steps:

- created a repo masvftest04 on GitHub
- cloned it here on Win10 using GitHub Desktop
   (needed to restart the GH desktop app to see the new repo)
- opened that repo as a new vault on Win10
- set up Obsidian Git Hotkeys

lookey what happened:
- did not 'save' the file before pushing and therefore lost half of the last sentence.
- Obsidian Console shows file was committed, but Pull failed because 'Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref 'refs/heads/main' from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.
   (error on Windows git setup default? or ....?)
   
- Now push asked to authorize git credentials via browser login or Personal Access Code
- chose browser login and accepted default authorizations
- and then the push succeeded.
